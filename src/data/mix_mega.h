// This table defines the stats associated with each Mega Stone when used for Mix and Mega.
// The format is as follows: {ATK, DEF, SP.ATK, SP.DEF, SPEED, Secondary typing, Ability
// If TYPE_NONE is chosen as the secondary typing, the stone won't affect secondary typing.
// If TYPE_NONE - 1 is chosen as the secondary typing, the stone will remove the user's secondary type.
// You can add new mega stones to this list.
// Just follow the same format, replacing the index (the STONE_WHATEVER part) with the new index you defined in include/mix_mega.h.
